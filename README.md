The goal of this project is to identify public opinion that has been associated to the rapidly spreading monkey pox outbreak using textual analytics of Twitter data. In order to identify sentiment, key word associations, and trends for crisis scenarios similar to the monkeypox phenomenon, this paper describes a scientific approach to evaluating Twitter data. With exploratory word clouds, charts, and sentiment maps, as well as descriptive text analytics and data visualization, we start the conversation and look for insights.<br>
In this study, sentimental analysis of Twitter data on public impression of monkey pox is done using the Text mining Algorithm. Results from the project will aid in the fight against the disease in a variety of sectors, including the public and private sectors. They will also help gather public opinion on the issue, enabling the government, concerned agents, and ministries to make well-informed decisions, policies, and regulations.
