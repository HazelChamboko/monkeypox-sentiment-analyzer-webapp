    "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The discipline of computer science, artificial intelligence and linguistics that is concerned with the creation of computational models that process and understand natural language. These include: making the computer understand the semantic grouping of words (e.g. cat and dog are semantically more similar than dog and spoon), text to speech, language translation and many more\n",

    "* **Sentiment Analysis:** It is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards certain words or topics.\n",

Suppose you have a dataset where students write an essay on the topic, My Bike. In this dataset, the bike word appears many times; it‚Äôs a high frequency word compared to other words in the dataset. The dataset contains other words like street, long ride, helmets and so on that appear less often, so their frequency are lower and they carry more information compared to the word. This is the intuition behind TF-IDF.\n",

Additionally, the model can identify 70.63% of the tweets as true positives. 21.28% of the tweets may be classified by the model as being truly negative. Additionally, the model categorizes 4.50% of the tweets as falsely positive. 3.60 percent of the tweets are categorized by the program as false negatives.
